# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest release and the default
branch. Older releases are not supported. Upgrade before reporting
an issue that may already be fixed.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue, pull request, or discussion for a suspected
vulnerability.

Use either private channel:

- **GitHub Security Advisories.** Open a private report from this
  repository's Security tab, **Report a vulnerability**. This is the
  preferred channel.
- **Email.** `jechenmailman@gmail.com`, with a subject line that begins
  with `[SECURITY]`.

Include the affected version, platform, impact, and steps to reproduce.
Do not attach credentials, tokens, or unredacted logs.

The maintainers aim to acknowledge a report within 5 business days, and
to coordinate a fix and disclosure within 90 days. There is no bug-bounty
promise.

## Operational notes

Runner input is operator-trusted. YAML is read with a safe loader. Child
processes are argument lists, and the shell is not used.

This project dispatches work to other runners and inherits their trust
model. Read the security policy of each runner before you send it a job you
did not write.
